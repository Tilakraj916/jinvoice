Creating Invoices and Quotes

The main focus of JInvoice is its ability to create invoices and quotes to your customers.

Managing Clients

JInvoice allows you to store client information, such as their company name, address, phone number, e-mail, and VAT number.
When you create an invoice or quote you can simply select what client itâ€™s for and the theme will fill in the rest for you. You can even send an e-mail to the client with a link to the invoice.

Security

The access to jinvoice is secured. If you want to share an invoice the url it will be unique and you change it later.
